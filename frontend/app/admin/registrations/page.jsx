/* SERVER component. Every decision that matters happens here:

   - The gate is the session's verified email, read server-side. Nothing about

     bypass — a non-admin gets a 404 before any data is fetched.
   - 404 rather than "not allowed", so the page's existence is not advertised to
     an account that cannot open it.
   - The read uses the service-role client, because RLS on `enrollments` limits
     every normal session to its own row. That key never leaves the server, and
